# Routing Index

This file is the **canonical lookup table** for natural-language trigger phrases.
It is consulted at routing time, ambiguity resolution time, or command discovery time.
It does NOT contain governance rules — those remain in `AGENTS.md`.

**Precedence**: `AGENTS.md` > `.agent/workflows/routing.md` > `.agent/skills/`

## 1. Workflow Trigger Map

### Core Phase Workflows

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "help me design", "幫我規劃" | `/plan` |
| "ship this", "上線吧" | `/ship` |
| "implement this", "開始寫", "動手做" | `/implement` |
| "review this", "幫我看看", "code review" | `/review` |

### Spec & Intake

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "here's my spec", "我有一個spec", "這是產品規格", user pastes a spec doc, user gives a file path to a spec | `/spec-intake` (do NOT jump directly to bootstrap or plan) |
| "next feature", "下一個", "繼續做", "continue with backlog" | `/spec-intake` §8a continuation (read `_product-backlog.md`, skip decomposition) |
| "改 spec", "amend the spec", "spec 要調整" | `/spec-intake` §8b amendment (check spec status, apply timing rules) |
| "先做 #5", "reorder", "defer #3", "不做了" | `/spec-intake` §8c reorder/defer/cancel |
| "寫規格", "write spec", "convert requirements" | `/spec` |

### Architecture & Setup

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "設定架構", "init app", "define tech stack", "set up project" | `/app-init` (full) |

## 2. Optional Module Trigger Map

> **Hard Rule (from AGENTS.md)**: Optional modules are explicit opt-in. The AI MUST NOT silently choose any optional module. Phrases in this section only activate a module when the user **clearly requests** it.

| Phrases | Module | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| "ask openrouter", "用其他模型" | `/ask-openrouter` | requires CLI |
| "run with codex", "用 codex" | `/codex-cli` | requires CLI |
| "run with claude", "用 claude", "用 claude-cli", "implement 交給 claude", "實作交給 claude", "測試交給 claude", "讓 claude 寫", "讓 claude 跑測試" | `/claude-cli` | requires CLI; MUST NOT auto-trigger |

---

## 3. Skill Activation Trigger Map

> **This table IS the canonical skill index** — it maps every user-facing trigger phrase to a skill ID. For "what skills are available?" questions, this is the answer. Skill bodies live in `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`; trigger metadata (phases, cost_risk, load_policy) lives in `.agentcortex/metadata/trigger-compact-index.json` when present.
>
> Skills activated via the Intent Router attach to the **current workflow phase only**. They MUST NOT replace, skip, or alter phase order. See AGENTS.md §Skill Safety & Precedence for the full hard rule.

| Phrases | Skill |
|---|---|
| "用 TDD", "test first", "先寫測試", "red green refactor" | `test-driven-development` |
| "API 設計", "endpoint conventions", "REST design" | `api-design` |
| "資料庫設計", "schema design", "migration safety" | `database-design` |
| "前端模式", "component patterns", "UI conventions" | `frontend-patterns` |
| "安全檢查", "auth check", "security review", "權限檢查" | `auth-security` |
| "紅隊測試", "adversarial test", "red team", "攻擊面分析" | `red-team-adversarial` |
| "debug", "除錯", "systematic debugging", "找 bug" | `systematic-debugging` |
| "平行開發", "parallel agents", "dispatch subtasks" | `dispatching-parallel-agents` |
| "subagent", "分派 agent", "multi-agent" | `subagent-driven-development` |
| "完成前檢查", "verify before done", "completion check" | `verification-before-completion` |
| "執行計畫", "execute the plan", "follow the plan" | `executing-plans` |
| "完成分支", "finish branch", "wrap up branch", "merge 準備" | `finishing-a-development-branch` |
| "接收 review", "review feedback", "收到 review 意見" | `receiving-code-review` |
| "請求 review", "request code review", "送 review", "要 review" | `requesting-code-review` |
| "用 worktree", "git worktree", "worktree 隔離" | `using-git-worktrees` |
| "寫計畫", "write plan", "規劃怎麼做" | `writing-plans` |
| "查文件", "check docs", "查官方文檔", "read the docs", "看文件再做" | `doc-lookup` |

## 4. Ambiguity Rules

1. **spec-intake vs bootstrap**: If the user provides a spec document or file path containing multiple features, route to `/spec-intake` — NOT directly to `/bootstrap` or `/plan`. Single-feature input without a spec document may proceed to `/bootstrap`.

2. **Optional module ambiguity**: A phrase like "用 claude" requires clear delegation intent. Ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "can Claude do this?") does NOT trigger `/claude-cli`. Require explicit delegation request before routing to any optional module.

3. **tiny-fix vs quick-win escalation**: Modifying `docs/specs/`, `docs/architecture/`, any file with `status: frozen`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/rules/*.md`, or `.agent/config.yaml` always escalates to quick-win minimum — even if fewer than 3 files are touched. (Authoritative rule in AGENTS.md §Agentic OS Runtime v5 rule 2.)

4. **Skill vs workflow**: If a user's request matches both a skill phrase (§3) and a workflow route (§1), route to the workflow phase first and activate the skill within that phase. Skills do not replace phase routing.

5. **Skill manual activation block**: Even when a user explicitly requests a skill, the bootstrap rule table's `Skip when` column governs. If the rule table says skip for the current classification, manual activation is blocked.

6. **Pinned skill vs skip-when precedence**: Pinned skills from user preferences (`.agentcortex/context/private/user-preferences.yaml`) follow the same skip-when rules as manually activated skills UNLESS the pin entry includes `force: true`. Force-pinned skills override skip-when but still respect `phase_scope` boundaries — a skill cannot activate in a phase it was never designed for. This is the ONLY mechanism that can override skip-when; manual activation (rule 5) cannot. See bootstrap §3.6a.

## 5. Command Discovery Notes

All commands are dispatched per `AGENTS.md §Agentic OS Runtime v5` and execute canonical workflows from `.agent/workflows/<command>.md`. For the Claude platform, dispatcher stubs live in `.claude/commands/<command>.md`.

> **Note**: `.agent/workflows/commands.md` is a compatibility alias. This routing index is the canonical source for command discovery.
